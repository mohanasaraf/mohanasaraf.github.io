                    as studying manipulators was a good starting point for studying robotics (and autonomous machines) in general. <br></p>

                <p class="text-justify text-para">Initially designed for heavy, repetitive manufacturing work; they are able to handle tasks that are difficult, dangerous or boring to human beings. Robotic systems are characterized by their degree-of freedom (DOF). A basic Robotic Manipulator
                    is composed of the set of links connected together by joints and an end effector or a gripper attached to the end of the arm to perform a set of action in the work volume of the robot.<br></p>
                <h5 class="project-page-right-heading">Degree of Freedom</h5>
                <p class="text-justify text-para-with-heading">Degrees of Freedom of a robot system is the minimum number of parameters or independent variables required to completely define the configuration of the system. In robotics, degree of freedom is often used to describe the number of directions
                    that a robot can pivot or move a joint. A very simple robotic system may have two degree-of-freedom, whereas a complex robotic system may have more than two degree-of-freedom (DOF). <br></p>
                <h5 class="project-page-right-heading">Redundancy</h5>
                <p class="text-justify text-para-with-heading">If a mechanism has more number of degrees of freedom than are required to perform a certain given task, then the mechanism is called redundant. For example, the human arm can be said to have 7 degrees of freedom whereas it requires only
                    6 to hold and orient an object at a desired pose, hence the human arm is said to have redundancy. It is because of this redundancy that the human arm is versatile and dexterous. It is capable of carrying out complex manoeuvres such
                    as those of avoiding obstacles, singularities and operate well within its structural limitations. Redundancy also makes a system more reliable as in the unfortunate case of a joint failure, the system can still perform the primary
                    task.<br></p>
                <h5 class="project-page-right-heading">Motion</h5>
                <p class="text-justify text-para-with-heading">The geometry of the motion of robotic arms is determined with respect to a fixed reference coordinate system. The resulting motion is obtained by composition of the small elementary motions of each link in the arm with respect to the previous
                    one. In a kinematic analysis the position, orientation, velocity and acceleration of all the links are calculated without taking into consideration the forces that cause this motion. The relationship between motion and the associated
                    forces and torques is studied in robot dynamics. <br></p>
                <h5 class="project-page-right-heading">Kinematics</h5>
                <p class="text-justify text-para-with-heading">Robot kinematics is the study of the motion (kinematics) of robots. It is concerned with aspects of redundancy, collision avoidance and singularity avoidance. It divides itself into two parts Direct or Forward Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics.
                    In Forward Kinematics, the length of each link and the angle of each joint is known and we have to calculate the position of the end-effector point in the task space of the robot. On the other hand, Inverse Kinematics is opposite of
                    Forward mapping. It produces the angles required to position the end-effector on a specified point in the task space.<br></p>

                <p class="text-justify text-para">To guide a robot to move from one position to another while minimizing the total number of steps. I have used A* Algorithm for finding a path from a start point to the destination as it combines the advantages of both Dijkstra’s algorithm
                    and Greedy Best-First-Search. Dijkstra’s algorithm expands outwards in all the direction from the starting point until it reaches the end goal. Whereas, Greedy Best-First-Search keeps a Heuristic estimate of how far the goal node is
                    from the vertex it is exploring thus selecting a vertex which is closest to the end node at each iteration. It runs much quickly as it uses the Heuristic function to guide its path. <br></p>
                <p class="text-justify text-para-with-heading">However, when the map has obstacles the path traced out by Greedy Best-First-Search is not optimal. Dijkstra works harder and is guaranteed to find the shortest path whereas Greedy Best-First-Search scans the map quickly and thus is unable
                    to find the best path. <br></p>

                    built can move continuously through its work space. Configuration Space or C-space is a handy mathematical and conceptual tool. Basically, C-space of a robot is set of all configurations that a robot can attain. With no obstacles in
                    the robot’s operational space, a robot can move freely in its task space. Presence of obstacles make certain configurations in the configuration space unattainable.&nbsp; <br></p>
